#Then/Now


##Work-Life Balance
* Then
  * Pressure to work long hours
  * Few boundaries
  * Set your own schedule
* Now
  * Nobody expects more than 40 hours per week
  * People are surprised when you respond to emails on weekends
  * Some expectation for a schedule resembling a 9-5


##Day-to-Day
* Then
  * Work on big-picture problems with far-off deadlines
  * Couple of meetings per week
* Now
  * Lots of smaller deadlines on short timescales
  * 2-5 meetings per day


##Tools
* Then
  * Python/Bash scripts, small C++ programs, some PHP
  * Smattering of shared memory parallelization and distributed computing
* Now
  * Python packages (modules, unit tests, code reviews, style standards, automated documentation)
  * Hadoop/Spark
  * AWS/Devops


##Perks
* Then
  * Set your own schedule
  * Occasional free lunch
* Now
  * Money (salary and 401(k) matching + bonus + stock)
  * Laptop + cell phone
  * t-shirts + other swag
  * Corporate travel
  * Occasional free lunch
